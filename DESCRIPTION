Description: 
	Metblocks is a R script that isolates variable methylated regions from whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data without sample group information.  
	Use cases include single group analysis or where there is considerable variation between samples. 
	An unsupervised approach allows for the isolation of subgroups or individual samples of interest that are often overlooked in group comparisons.
